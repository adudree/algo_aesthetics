## Getting Started

You will need to have Node installed ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/))  
Download this repository and open it in your favorite IDE (I would **highly** recommend VS Code ([https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)))  
Then open a terminal at the root of the folder (you can do it in VS Code by simply dragging up the bottom of the window) and type the following commands :

### Installing

```
npm i -g npm-run-all typescript browser-sync
```

Only use this command the first time you ever use this template (-g means you install things globally)

### Launching

```
npm start
```
