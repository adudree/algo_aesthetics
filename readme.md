## My artwork 

* Inspired by [Manuel Barbadillo - IRAINA (1966)](http://dada.compart-bremen.de/item/artwork/493).

## My pseudocode 

- **1x1 square** 
    - Import 1 picture (Black or White)

- **2x2 square**
    - Take 1 picture as reference (color & position)
    - Create a 2x2 pictures grid (duplicate, translate, rotate, change color)
- **4x4 square** 
    - Take 1 2x2 square as reference (colorRef, position)
    - Create a 4x4 grid with 4 2x2 squares (duplicate, translate, rotate & change reference color)
- **N*N square**
    - Create a N*N grid duplicating the 4x4 square N times (in my reference artwork, N=1)  
- **[BONUS] MousePressed**
    - Change color of each case of the N*N grid by pressing the mouse
